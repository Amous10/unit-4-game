// create a random number array that generates a number"target-value" between 19 and 120



// create random array 1 thru 12 that randomly sets separate values to 4 different buttons/images

//create a loop stop when the number values are assigned. 

// create click event that same number per button, writes to document

// create function that adds button number value to "guess-total"(counter)

// write if statement that if "target-number" is equal to "guess-total", player wins: alert 
// 'you win' and adds 1 to "win-count"

// if "guess-total" is greater than "target-number", player loses, alert "you lose", add 1 to "loss-count"

// if neither conditions are met, function continues running,

//when player wins or loses, game resets and loop runs again.
//users score and score counter will be set to zero

// place codes inside div containers ex;  value total, target value,  alerts, win/loss totals
